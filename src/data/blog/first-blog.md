# First Step is the Hardest

I always used blog framework like WordPress, Blogger and Hexo for my blog site. It's easy but as a developer, I feel better to build my own site from scratch. This is a process of reinventing the wheel and seems meaningless and boring, but it does reinforce my understanding of building the front end of a website. 

The thunmnail you saw for this page is a picture I took when I was studying in UBC. I was dreaming to be a photographer at that time but I couldn't make it because of lack of money and time. Now I start my career in coding and will go along the journey of becoming a better developer. I hope this blog site can record my life and work events so that I can look back and see how I grow.

KEEP YOUR DREAM ALIVE!
