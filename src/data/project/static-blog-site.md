# Idea

The site should be easy to be maintained and updated, so I decided to use NextJS and markdown files to build this site and deploy it with Firebase. The accomplishment of this project includes:

- Rendering markdown files in NextJS
- Use MUI for the UI components
- Build the site to be static file and deploy it to Firebase
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Add Google Analytics to the site
- Use motion.js for animations

Since this site is just for demonstrating my life and projects, I won't spend much time adding more fancy features such as dark mode, comment section, etc. Please feel free to reach out to me through Linkedin. I am always happy to chat with you.

# Desktop version

The GIF below shows the site in action:

And the site also has mobile version

I probably will add tags function for this site in the future.
